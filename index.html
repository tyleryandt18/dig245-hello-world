<h1>Hello, my name is Tyler Yandt.</h1>
<h2>I am a senior at Davidson, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science.
    <br>
    I am taking this class because I want to develop my frontend coding skills. I want to become a 
    Data Analyst for a sports team, whether that be at the college or professional level. While my
    CS classes will teach me how to run the backend and analyze data, I want to be
    able to present the data in a clean and clear manner.
    <br>
    In terms of creative experience, I picked up photography two summers ago when I 
    bought myself a camera. I had a remote internship, so I told myself I was going to
    take a picture every day of the summer to learn how to work with it.
