    <h1>About Tyler Yandt</h1>
    <p>I am a senior at Davidson, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science.
        <br><br>
        I am taking this class because I want to develop my frontend coding skills. I want to become a 
        Data Analyst for a sports team, whether that be at the college or professional level. While my
        CS classes will teach me how to run the backend and analyze data, I want to be
        able to present the data in a clean and clear manner.
        <br><br>
        In terms of creative experience, I picked up photography two summers ago when I 
        bought myself a camera. I had a remote internship, so I told myself I was going to
        take a picture every day of the summer to learn how to work with it.

        Furthermore, I have been coding since Day 1 here at Davidson. This past summer,
        I completed an internship where I used R Shiny, a tool within R, to create an
        interactive dashboard for a nonprofit organization in CREED. We analyzed data
        regarding public school boards in North Carolina and how well (or often poorly)
        they represent the students they govern. While I felt comfortable using this package,
        it was not directly creating a website with HTML and JavaScipt, which leads me into
        my goals for the class.
        <br><br>
        At the end of the course, I want to be able to build interactive webpages, where
        the data that I analyze and models that I create work directly with the website.
        I had mentioned earlier how my dream career requires an ability to clearly present
        analytics in a way such that anyone and everyone can understand it. Hopefully I can also
        takeaway from this course skills to make these webpages and dashboards visually appealing.

    <h3>learn-computing Summary:</h3>
    <p>I chose to learn about APIs because I want to work with data when I graduate. APIs
        are used everywhere; they connect data and/or other functionality to the software that
        uses them. If I use an API, I can specify my requests, similarly to a search engine. Most APIs
        are free, but some require authentication. The URL of an API can be broken down into three
        parts; the 'https', which provides security over computer networks, the API's host, and then
        lastly the information that follows the '/' after the host. This is essentially the search
        engine's criteria. I practiced by using the Spotify API. I pulled my top 5 songs from the 
        past 30 days (all were from the new Travis Scott album, Utopia), and got new recommendations.
