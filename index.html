    <h1>About Tyler Yandt</h1>
    <p>I am a senior at Davidson, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science.
        <br><br>
        I am taking this class because I want to develop my frontend coding skills. I want to become a 
        Data Analyst for a sports team, whether that be at the college or professional level. While my
        CS classes will teach me how to run the backend and analyze data, I want to be
        able to present the data in a clean and clear manner.
        <br><br>
        In terms of creative experience, I picked up photography two summers ago when I 
        bought myself a camera. I had a remote internship, so I told myself I was going to
        take a picture every day of the summer to learn how to work with it.

        <p>Furthermore, I have been coding since Day 1 here at Davidson. This past summer,
            I completed an internship where I used R Shiny, a tool within R, to create an
            interactive dashboard for a nonprofit organization in CREED. We analyzed data
            regarding public school boards in North Carolina and how well (or often poorly)
            they represent the students they govern. While I felt comfortable using this package,
            it was not directly creating a website with HTML and JavaScipt, which leads me into
            my goals for the class.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>At the end of the course, I want to be able to build interactive webpages, where
            the data that I analyze and models that I create work directly with the website.
            I had mentioned earlier how my dream career requires an ability to clearly present
            analytics in a way such that anyone and everyone can understand it. Hopefully I can also
            takeaway from this course skills to make these webpages and dashboards visually appealing.
